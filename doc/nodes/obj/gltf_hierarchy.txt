= glTF =

The glTF hierarchy importer can import a glTF scene as a network of nodes or as flattened geometry.
See the following link for further information about the [glTF format|https://www.khronos.org/gltf/].

@parameters

File Name:
	#id: filename

	The glTF file to.  The loading method depends on the extension of the file loaded.  
	
	Files with a .glb extension be treated as binary GLB files.
	
	Files with a .gltf extension will be loaded as normal JSON data.

Asset Extraction Folder:
	#id: assetfolder

	Textures packed into a glTF binary buffer or represented as base64 data must be unpacked before usage.  
	
	This field specifies the location textures are to be unpacked on disk.

Scene:
	#id: scene

	Select the scene to import from the glTF object.
	
	In the absence of a scene name, the label will be based off the scene index.

Build Scene:
	#id: buildscene

	Build the scene from the input parameters.  If the scene was loaded previously, this will reload the scene hierarchy and geometry.

Lock Geometry:
	#id: lockgeo

	Enable this option to lock any geometry nodes created during scene building.

Flatten Hierarchy:
	#id:flattenhierarchy

	Flatten all nodes in the scene down to a single node containing all the 
	geometry.

Promote Point Attributes To Vertex:
	#id: promotepointattrs

	Promote all point attributes (excluding P) to vertex attributes.

Points Merge Distance:
	#id: pointconsolidatedist

	When __Promote Point Attributes To Vertex__ is enabled, points within this distance to each other will be merged.


== Filter Options ==

Import Geometry:
	#id: importgeometry

	Enable this option to import geometry objects.  When disabled, glTF meshes will be loaded as empty Geometry nodes.

Import Custom Attributes:
	#id: importcustomattributes

	Enable this option to import any custom attributes from glTF primitives.
	
	Custom attributes in glTF are prefixed with an underscore _ which will be stripped during import. 

Import Materials:
	#id: importmaterials

	Enable this option to import glTF materials as Principled Shader materials.  This also creates material assignments.
	
	If this option is disabled, materials and material assignments will not be created.

Import Non-Geometry:
	#id: importnongeo

	Import nodes which do not create or transform any geometry.  Disable this to remove unused nodes when the additional hierarchical data is unneeded.

Import Unused Materials:
	#id: importunusedmaterials

	Import all materials available, even if they are not assigned or used by the imported scene.
