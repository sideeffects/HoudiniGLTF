= glTF =

The glTF ROP can export your scene as a GLTF file.
See the following link for further information about the [glTF format|https://www.khronos.org/gltf/].

@parameters

Render to Disk:
	#id: execute

        Begins the render with the last render control settings.

Controls...:
	#id: renderdialog

        Opens the render control dialog to allow adjustments of the render parameters before rendering.

File Name:
	#id: file

        The path of the file to generate.  The extension determines the type of file to generate.
	
	A path with a `.glb` extension generates a single binary GLB file and stores all resources internally.
	
	A path with a `.gltf` extension may store some resources externally.  Exported resources are stored in the same folder as the file and are referenced relatively. 

Texture Format:
	#id: format

	Save all images and textures using this file format.

Max Texture Resolution:
    #id: maxresolution

    If any texture is larger than this resolution then downsize it to this resolution.  Useful for quickly reducing file size.

Texture Quality:
    #id: imagequality

	The level of compression to apply to outputted textures.  Only applies to lossy image formats.


Root Object:
	#id: root

        The root object of the scene. All objects contained under this node will be included in the glTF scene.

Objects:
	#id: objects
	
        A pattern/bundle of objects to include in the glTF scene.

Flip Normal Map Y:
    #id: flipnormalmapy

    Invert the y-coordinate on the normal texture map for each exported mesh.  glTF's orientation expects an upwards
    facing y-axis.

Save All Non-Displayed (Hidden) Objects:
	#id: savehidden

	If this checkbox is turned on, hidden objects matching the __Objects__ pattern/bundle will also written to the glTF scene.

Export Custom Attributes:
	#id: exportcustom

	If this checkbox is turned off, only attributes defined in the glTF standard are exported.

	Otherwise, all public attributes are exported.

	Attributes are exported with their original types when possible.  However, glTF allows a maximum of 32 bits for floats and integers.  Integers are also required to be unsigned.
	
	Attempting to export a datatypes larger than this will narrow the type and print a warning.

	Exported custom attribute names are the original names plus an _ (underscore) prefix.

	As glTF only supports point attributes, name collisions will be resolved using the normal attribute resolution order.

Export Node Names:
	#id: exportnames

	This assigns Houdini node names to the name field of glTF objects.
	
	In addition, the name attribute on packed primitives will be exported.

	Names are assigned to materials, transformation nodes and geometry.

Export Materials:
	#id: exportmaterials

        Enabling this option exports Principled Shader materials.
	
	Materials are exported as a combination of emissive maps, normal maps, and PBRMetallicRoughness materials.

	All associated textures and images used by the material are exported alongside the material.

	Some Principled Shader options such as ambient occlusion and subsurface scattering are not exported.  
	
	Materials that do not use the Principled Shader will be ignored.

Cull Empty Nodes:
	#id: cullempty

	Enabling this will cause any Object node which has no descendents containing geometry to be ignored.

Rescale Texture as Power of Two:
	#id: poweroftwo

	This will rescale exported images so that the final image has dimensions which are powers of two (eg. 512x1024, 2048x2048).
	
	This is required by some low-spec glTF implementations as well as WebGL implementations in older browsers.
